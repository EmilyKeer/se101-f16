Hi Stephane,

(*@\textcircled{3}@*)

I've heard that your Software Engineering programme managed to get
re-accredited without mandatory Chemistry. We've been trying to
figure out what's the smallest amount of chemistry we could include
here at Waterloo in Software Engineering.

Did you receive any feedback from the CEAB about not including chemistry? (*@\textcircled{4}@*)

Thanks!
